## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do you think you have found a serious security vulnerability in CCIDB (either the FOSS version or online version should you have access)? **PLEASE DO NOT CREATE AN ISSUE ABOUT IT!!!** Instead, please email __ccidb-sec@wagspuzzle.space__ with details, such as what the vulnerability is, how to reproduce it, and other details regarding the vulnerability. All emails sent to this address will be opened and responded to within 24 hours at most. If the vulnerability is confirmed, it will be fixed and you will be credited on both the GitHub repo and website. While I cannot guarantee a bug bounty, please know I take security seriously and any report is valid, even if you don't believe so.
