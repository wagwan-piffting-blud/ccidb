				<span>Deleting records. It's a dangerous thing to do, but, let's say, for example, you sell a coin to someone else or for whatever other reason the coin is no longer in your collection. This is where this tool comes in handy. All you need to do is get the barcode for the record you wish to delete, enter it into the Delete Records screen, click "Delete Record", review and make ABSOLUTELY SURE it's the right record, then click "Yes" once you're sure you wish to PERMANENTLY delete all of the record's information. Part of the process is shown in image form below:</span>

				<br>
				<br>
				<span>Please keep the following in mind if you choose to delete a record:</span>
				<br>
				<br>
				<span>- As soon as the record is deleted, it cannot and will not be recoverable in any form. The information is gone FOREVER. Please make ABSOLUTELY SURE you wish to actually delete it before choosing to do so, as the developer cannot recover any deleted records for ANY reason.</span>
				<br>
				<br>
				<span>- The only information saved from a deleted record is the barcode and line number. This is so the record can be reused later if you wish.</span>
