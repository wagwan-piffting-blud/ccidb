				<br>
				<span>CCIDB has a function built in where you can see basic statistics about your collection. This includes a heatmap of countries that your coins come from! This heatmap is especially helpful if you are a OFEC (One From Every Country) collector, this way, you can see how you're doing visually on your personal progress.</span>
				<br>
				<br>
				<span>On the statistics screen, we have basic information, like the version number of CCIDB and how many lines of code it's running on. We also have a total number of active records (useful for seeing how many total coins you have in your collection) and total number of countries represented. There is also the number of records you have images for, how many total images you have, and how many records do NOT have images. As a "fun fact", you also can see how much total money you have spent on your collection so far (this sums up the "Cost" field across all your active records) by clicking the "click to reveal" text. You can also hide this information from prying eyes by clicking the same text (which now says "click to hide"). The total cost is hidden by default.</span>
