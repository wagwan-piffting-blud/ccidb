				<span>First time using CCIDB? Well, welcome aboard! As the primary developer for CCIDB, I am happy you joined me on this adventure and hope that you are able to use CCIDB to its maximum potential with this guide.</span>
				<br>
				<br>
				<span>Let us start where every user starts, at the activation screen. When you purchased a license through Gumroad, you should have received an email with your activation key. If you have NOT received this, please <a href="mailto:ccidb@wagspuzzle.space" target="_blank">send me an email</a> and I will get you everything you need to continue.</span>

				<br>
				<br>
				<span>Once you enter your activation key for the first time, you will be taken to the settings page so you can set your username and password as well as other options to your liking, for example, changing if the site is Light or Dark themed, the font used throughout the site, and your timezone, which is in the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones" target="_blank">TZ format</a>" (you can click the previous link to learn more!).</span>

				<br>
				<br>
				<span>After you do this, you will see a screen telling you your settings were saved and to log in with your new credentials. After you log in, you're ready to get started adding your coin collection!</span>
