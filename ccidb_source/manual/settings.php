				<span>Updating your settings is a very simple task, made easier by grabbing your current settings and putting them in automatically. If you ever need to update your settings, though, feel free!</span>
				<br>
				<br>
				<span>As well, on this screen, you get to change your password if you wish. Please note you are NOT able to change your username once you set it, so please keep that in mind!</span>
